These details are then sent to our backend system, where sophisticated algorithms modify the documents accordingly. The updated documents are seamlessly displayed on the ReactJS interface, allowing users to make further modifications if needed. Finally, users can download the documents in DOCX format for easy editing. Plus, our added login authentication ensures security throughout the process."
